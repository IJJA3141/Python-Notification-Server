# Python Notification Server

This project provides a customizable notification server implemented in Python, enabling users to manage and interact with notifications in their desktop environment. The server is designed to handle various notification-related tasks, such as displaying notifications, tracking notification history, and providing commands for interacting with notifications.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features:

- **Notification Display:** The server supports the display of notifications with essential details such as application name, icon, summary, and body.
- **Notification History:** Users can query the notification server to retrieve a list of past notifications, facilitating a quick review of recent activities.
- **Notification Removal:** The server allows users to remove specific notifications by providing their unique IDs.
- **Action Handling:** Notifications may include actions, and the server can respond to these actions, providing a versatile user interaction experience.
- **Notification Logging:** The server features a comprehensive notification logging system that records all notifications sent to the server. This information is stored in a log file, allowing users to maintain a detailed record of notification activities over time.

## üì¶ Installation

- Clone the repository.
- If required, install the following dependencies: `dbus-python`, `libnotify`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

- Explore the code to customize the server behavior to suit your preferences.
- Adapt the notification handling logic according to your needs.

**Customization Example:**
[test.py](https://github.com/IJJA3141/Python-Notification-Server/blob/main/test.py)

```python
from dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop
from gi.repository import GLib
import NotificationServer

# Not needed, just for the example
import threading
import time
import os


DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)

def wait_and_clear():
    time.sleep(5)
    os.system("clear")
    return

def print_example(self):
    os.system("clear")
    for notification_key in self.notifications:
        print("key", notification_key)

    timer_thread = threading.Thread(target=wait_and_clear)
    timer_thread.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = NotificationServer.NotificationServer()

    # You can modify the default timeout like this
    server.default_timeout = 2000

    # And to modify the printing behavior use this
    server.print_state = print_example.__get__(server)

    mainloop = GLib.MainLoop()
    mainloop.run()
```

## üß∞ Usage:

0. Import NotificationServer
1. Create a NotificationServer
2. Modify it as you need
3. Run the Python Notification Server script.
4. Interact with the server using commands like `shw-msg` and `rm-msg`.

### Commands

- **üì£ Show Notification Server History:**
  Use the `shw-msg` command to display a list of the notification server's history. You can also query a specific notification by providing its ID (it is optional).

  ```zsh
  notify-send ' ' -a 'shw-msg'
  notify-send ' ' -a 'shw-msg' -r [notification_id]
  ```

- **üóëÔ∏è Remove Notification:**
  Utilize the rm-msg command to remove a specific notification from the server by providing its ID. (It won't be removed from the history)
  ```zsh
  notify-send ' ' -a 'rm-msg' -r [notification_id]
  ```

## üí• Issues

If no notification is shown, it might be that another process already uses `org.freedesktop.Notification`. Try the following command in your terminal:

```zsh
dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus  /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames | grep Notification
```

If something shows up, it means it is already in use.

## üé≠ Motivations

I use a modified version of this server for myself that can be found in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/IJJA3141/.config/blob/linux/eww/scripts/notification.py) and couldn't find anything similar. So, if it can be useful to someone, it's here.
